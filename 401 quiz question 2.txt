The final project I will be working on includes video interaction. Our group hasn't 
specifically decided what to do yet. 

A possible project would look like this:

The user walks into a room with a screen. The projector's light is in your face and the user
waits for the signal to start their interaction with the computer. The user will then be 
recorded and taped. They will see their recording and that will played and mixed into a 
seperate video. THAT clip will then be blended into another video clip and so on. 

We plan on using processing and possibly iMovie with a green screen. However, I have worked 
with blending a snapshot into a video clip. Hopefully my experience with blending features 
will help. 

This project would be such an artistic piece since it would be mostly like a collage of video 
clips. Every single area of the displayed screen would be unique in a way and make the user 
think about the true meaning of it. To make it have a true significant meaning, the video 
clips would display a well known scenery of every state in the country. The finished piece 
would give an unique representation of the user "in all 50 states".
